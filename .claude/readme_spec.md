I have a summary report located `output/BLIND_STUDY_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` as well as other whitepaper reports located in the `output/` directory. Please make a **Summary** section with a summary using "plain language" (like a TL;DR) for the project root `README.md`. This should be a readable summary statement that anyone in the general public can get an idea of the repo's purpose. The summary should be 1000-1500 words. After the summary please make a **Reports** listing with links to the other whitepaper reports under `output/` . Each listing entry should include the report title and a brief 200-500 word description.
